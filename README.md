The following scripts were used in a master's thesis carried out at Chalmers University of Technology during the spring of 2025, titled "Assessing the Stringer-Panel Method as an Alternative Design Approach for Deep Beams - A Comparative Study with the Strut-and-Tie Method". The thesis can be found on the following link: 

# SPM-deep-beams.py
The script uses the Stringer-Panel Method to create a stringer-panel model and dimension the reinforcement in the stringers and panels accordingly. The outputs from the script are the reinforcement area needed in each stringer, the reinforcement area needed in each panel, total reinforcement volume, displacement for each DOF, the normal forces at the beginning and end of each stringer, the shear forces in each panel, and the support reactions. 

The first part of the script, which creates the stringer-panel grid according to the beam geometry, as well as the parts for dimensioning reinforcement and checking stresses, was written by the authors of this thesis. The part of the script that handles calculations of forces and displacements (marked in the script) was written by P.C.J. Hoogenboom and last updated on November 28, 2017. The link to Hoogenboom's original script, called SPM.py, can be found in the book "Stringer-Panel Models in Structural Concrete - Applied to D-region Design" written by Johan Blaauwendraad (2018), (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-76678-2.pdf), and examples and further explanation of the script can be found in the manual written by Hoogenboom, which can be found in a link in the same book by Blaauwendraad.
